## 🧠 Strategic Learning Summaries

### Week 1: Building the Secure Foundation

* **Day 03 (Data Sovereignty):** Engineered an encrypted S3 Knowledge Base with "Block Public Access" and Versioning. 
    * *Director Insight:* We have ensured that our company's "ground truth" data is encrypted at rest and in transit. By choosing Amazon Bedrock over public APIs, we've guaranteed that our intellectual property is never used to train public models, maintaining a closed-loop ecosystem.

**Analogy of the Week:** "The VPC is our building, IAM is the badge, and S3 is the bank vault inside. Even if someone got into the building, the vault is locked and encrypted. We aren't just storing data; we are protecting our competitive advantage."
