### Day 9: S3 Knowledge Lake & Data Governance
* **Tech Focus:** Provisioning a globally unique S3 bucket with **Versioning** and **Public Access Blocks**.
* **Leadership Focus:** Risk Mitigation & Security Baselines. By codifying S3 security, we eliminate "human error" that leads to data leaks.
* **Analogy of the Week:** "If RDS is the organized filing cabinet (Structured), S3 is the secure library (Unstructured). We've ensured that while the library can hold millions of books, the doors are locked to the public, and we keep a history of every book's revision."
