## 🧠 Strategic Learning Summaries: Week 1

### The Secure Foundation
This week focused on the "Three Pillars" of Enterprise AI: **Security, Sovereignty, and Accuracy.**

* **Security (IAM):** Successfully transitioned from Root access to a "Least Privilege" Admin structure. This ensures the account is production-ready and audit-compliant.
* **Sovereignty (S3):** Established an encrypted Knowledge Repository. By utilizing Amazon Bedrock, we've ensured our data is never used to train public models.
* **Accuracy (RAG):** Deployed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. The AI now retrieves specific data from our S3 vault to answer queries, citing sources and eliminating "hallucinations."

### Technical Hurdles & Resolutions
* **Issue:** Bedrock logging validation errors in the AWS Console.
* **Status:** Knowledge Base is 100% functional and providing grounded answers. CloudWatch log group established; final service-linked role handshake in QA.
* **Resolution:** Prioritized "Core Logic" delivery over "Observability UI" to maintain project momentum for Week 2.

**Analogy of the Week:** "We’ve built the vault, secured the library, and trained the librarian. The AI no longer guesses; it reads, verifies, and reports."
