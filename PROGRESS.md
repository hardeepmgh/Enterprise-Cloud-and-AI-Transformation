### Day 10: IAM Security & Identity
* **Tech Focus:** Created a **Least-Privilege IAM Role** for the AI Assistant. Implemented a custom policy granting access only to the S3 Knowledge Lake and RDS instance.
* **Leadership Focus:** Zero Trust Architecture. By ensuring the AI logic has no permanent credentials (using Roles instead of Keys), we've hardened the application against credential theft.
* **Analogy of the Week:** "The infrastructure is the building, and the IAM Role is the security badge. We just issued a badge that only opens the library and the filing room—not the server room or the CEO's office."
