## 🧠 Strategic Learning Summaries

### Week 1: Building the Secure Foundation
**Focus:** Establishing a Zero-Trust environment for Enterprise AI.

* **Day 01 (Networking):** Architected a custom VPC with isolated private subnets. 
    * *Director Insight:* By hand-mapping route tables, we ensure absolute control over data egress, preventing "shadow" data leaks.
* **Day 02 (Governance):** Implemented IAM Execution Roles and Stateful Security Groups.
    * *Director Insight:* Identity is our new perimeter. We've eliminated the risk of static credential theft by moving to ephemeral, role-based access.

**Analogy of the Week:** "The VPC is our building, and the IAM Roles are the biometric badges. We don't give everyone a key to the front door; we give them a badge that only works for the specific room they need to enter, exactly when they need it."
