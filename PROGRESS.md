## 🧠 Weekly Learning Summaries (Continued)

### Week 2: The Data Layer & State Governance
* **Tech Focus:** Provisioning a private Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL) instance. Successfully navigated a "Default VPC" conflict by implementing an **Explicit Subnet Group** and **Dependency Mapping** (`depends_on`).
* **Leadership Focus:** High-Availability (HA) Design & Data Isolation. Shifting from "default configurations" to "explicit governance" to ensure security baselines.
* **Analogy of the Week:** "Setting up RDS is like installing a vault inside our building. We don't just put it in the lobby (Public Subnet); we place it in a secured room (Private Subnet) and explicitly define who has the key (Security Groups)."
