- Migrate the manual setup into **Terraform (IaC)** for repeatable deployments.
- Implement Enterprise-grade security (IAM, Security Groups, and NACLs).

## 📂 Folder Contents
- `/01-Architecture-Designs`: Visual diagrams of the network topology.
- `/02-Manual-Baseline-Labs`: Documentation of the manual AWS Console builds.
- `/03-Terraform-Landing-Zone`: Production-ready IaC scripts.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Cloud:** AWS (VPC, Subnets, IGW, NAT Gateway)
- **Security:** IAM Roles, Security Groups
- **Automation:** Terraform
